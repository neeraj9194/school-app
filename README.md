# SCHOOL APP


School an application to create, list, edit delete Students and Teachers.

A system where we can have a Teacher and Student. 

- One teacher can have many students and students can have many teachers.

- User be able to do the following:

Even though teachers teach all their associated students, they would like to 
highlight exceptional students with a “star”.
